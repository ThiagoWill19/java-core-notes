# Java Core Notes ☕📘

This repository contains **technical articles and notes about Java language fundamentals**
(Java Core), focusing on concepts that truly matter in real-world Java development.

The goal is not to provide quick tips, but to build a **solid understanding of the language**:
compiler rules, scope, inheritance, memory, collections, and other topics that help developers
write correct, readable, and predictable code.
